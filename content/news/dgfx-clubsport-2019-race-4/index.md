What, Catalunya again?! Yes, unfortunately all series and leagues ended up at Catalunya over the span of just a couple of weeks but the Clubsport series should be the last start on that track for some time. So it was just to buckle up and focus on the mission - to bring Hellracers our second win in the Clubsport series. Since this was a 4 hour race, more points were on the line than the 2.4 hour races, so of course a win is even more valuable for the championship.

We put Hampus Baaz and Jonas Bodin on this important mission and they started out really well - Jonas put the car on pole and took off, leaving the competition behind. Given that the teams are on slightly different pit strategies, it’s not always easy to know which car is actually in the lead, but the Hellracers Porsche was mostly in P1 and the strategy seemed to work as intended.

Halfway through, Hampus took over the wheel and continued in the lead. It wasn’t until the race had about 30 minutes left it became really exciting when the Racekraft Esports entry caught up to Hampus and they started to fight for the race lead. All pit stops were done, so it was game on! Racekraft had just overtook Hampus when they got information from race control - Stop&Go penalty for an incident with another car. The Hellracers car once again took over the lead, and now with a comfortable cushion down to second place. With 15 minutes to go, it was just a matter of bringing the car home. The tires were worn, giving Hampus a bit of a challenge to do just that, but he kept his nerves and drove over the finish line with 15 seconds down to second place.

Mission accomplished - second victory in the Clubsport series keeping us in a good spot for the championship. Thanks to Racekraft Esports for the fight!
