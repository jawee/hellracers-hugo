IVRA Clubsport is a fun league. Not all races can be fun, though. This was one of the less fun, unfortunately.

The new season of IVRA Clubsport started this weekend with a 2.4 hour race at Road America. We have described the concept previously, but in short the league shares some similarities to IVRA Endurance but with other car classes and other track choices.

We have qualified two Porsche 911 GT3 Cup cars to this league and it was time to show our pace in them. Last year, we finished P2 overall in the class so we had things to prove.

Well, without going into too much detail since the wounds have yet to heal, the race wasn’t a huge success. Both cars were involved in incidents, there were driver mistakes and all-in-all it was an experience that you try to learn from and move on. Not all races can be successes and the ones you typically learn the most from are the ones where things don’t go as planned.

So, did we finish last and second last? Not even close! P8 and P15 were our finishing positions and while it is not a disaster, it was not what we hoped for. But being the season opener and with several races to go, there is still time to redeem ourselves!
