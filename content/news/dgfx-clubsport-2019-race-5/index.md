We have come to appreciate the tight racing that this series brings, the mix of good racing within the Porsche 911 Cup class and the heavy traffic with the MX-5s and the TCRs makes for exciting races where everything can - and will - happen. It was time for Andreas Olsson to drive his first stint in this series, and he had Hampus Baaz as his partner in crime.

The race tempo of our car was high, but a few too many mistakes were made along the way to be able to compete for the podium. The sweeping corners of Phillip Island are easy to overshoot when trying to push, especially combined with a lot of cars on the track. But since the pace was good, each mistake was followed by some quick laps and an overtake or two, and the distance to the podium cars didnâ€™t escalate too much.

In the end, our car passed the finish line in fifth place, around 30 seconds after the winner. A decent result, but with fewer mistakes a better result was definitely within reach.

This made us the new class leader with only one race to go - the 4 hours at Interlagos in April. Could it be our first title as Hellracers?! Time to start practicing...
