After a battle raging over 13 rounds in the second season of the ARLTC league in 2020, Rickard takes home the AM championship! The season started already in August 2020 and each round have included three races, meaning that the challenge is not only to be fast but to be consistent over a wide range of tracks and races. It’s quite an accomplishment with the high level of TCR racing in the league to take the win!

We have competed in several of the Apex leagues and are always pleasantly surprised by the arrangement and the wide range of competition that it brings. The ARLTC league is probably one of the most challenging ones, attracting what is probably the fastest TCR drivers on the iRacing service. The league is divided into PRO and AM categories where the fastest guys compete in the PRO category but the AM category is also filled with some fierce competition.

The format with three races in each round where the starting order of race two and three reverses part of the field led to some intense racing, and Rickard described races where he was physically and mentally drained afterwards since there wasn’t a second of relaxation in the race. The TCR cars invite close racing and it is not uncommon to see the field fighting closely in big groups even at the end of the races, which is a contrast to GT racing where the field tends to split up a bit more over a race.

Unfortunately Rickard’s partner in crime in the TCR series, Philip, had too many series ongoing so he had to step down from this one, meaning that the team championship slipped out of our hands. But that only means that we have a reason to come back and try to take home that as well!
