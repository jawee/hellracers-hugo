Once again, two different endurance series clashed during the weekend with an IVRA Clubsport 4 hour race on Saturday and a 24H SERIES ESPORTS 6 hour race on Sunday. Our two Porsche 911 GT3 Cup cars did a good job at Spa-Francorchamps and our #26 car managed a 6th place in a tough competition, after having run the last stint with some serious fuel saving. The #16 car unfortunately didn’t manage to save enough and had to stop for an extra pit stop, putting them down all the way to 17th place, due to the close field.

For the long races in the IVRA Clubsport league, points are also awarded halfway through the race and both cars managed to get some good points at the halfway point, leading to a good amount of points for the full race. It brings some extra strategy into the race, especially this time with two safety cars just before halfway through the race, creating the need for some quick decision-making. An extra spice to endurance racing!

The other race for the weekend was 6 hours of Silverstone in our trusty Porsche Cayman GT4. Also in this league, the competition is fierce and it’s really a matter of putting the hours in when preparing for the race unless you want to be a backmarker. We had decent pace, but were slower than we wanted and just behind the big mid-pack of cars. At the time for pit stop, we were running in 8th after having an incident just before the pit stop, losing a position.

Not even 10 minutes into our second stint, our driver suffered a technical malfunction that put our car hard into the wall. The car was possible to repair but we parked it for the night to avoid being an obstacle on track, since even after repair the car is usually down on pace. An unfortunate ending to an otherwise fun race.
