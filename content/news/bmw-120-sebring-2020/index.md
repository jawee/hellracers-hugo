No less than four Hellracers cars were on the starting line for this event, with a price pool of around $4000 and a chance to compete with the big boys. This series, sponsored by BMW, runs the BMW M8 GTE car in a really tight “short endurance” race where two drivers per car compete over two hours for the grand prize. Our cars in the first split had about the toughest competition found on the iRacing service and found themselves at 31st and 35th position in the end, while our cars in second split managed a better result, finishing in 2nd and 4th position. 

This was our first endurance event with such a strong competition, and we will learn from this experience and come even better prepared for the next one, taking place at Nürburgring in May.
