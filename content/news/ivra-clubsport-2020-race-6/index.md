It was time for the season finale in the IVRA Clubsport league 20/21! On paper, our #26 car had a theoretical chance of taking home the championship but that was mostly on paper.. For that to happen, several strong teams had to have a really bad day and the focus was not on that chance but rather on bringing home a good result for the day.

The cars gridded P4 and P6 after a good qualifying session and the race started … and went to full course caution almost immediately. And started, and went to caution. And so it continued with a third caution as well. The first three cautions took place within the first hour of the race and we were worried that this would be a race spent more behind the pace car than actually racing.

But then, after the third restart the race went green for the rest of the race, leading to 5 hours of uninterrupted multiclass racing with some great racing. Endurance and multiclass is a real fun combination, where everything can happen. The #16 car dropped some positions during the race and ended up P9 for a total championship position of P13. The #26 car worked their way up to P3 and ended up P7 in the championship. Both a step down from our P2 championship spot from last year, partly due to an even better starting field this year but also due to some mistakes along the way leading to lost points that are really hard to gain back.

Thank you to the IVRA organization for this season! Even though they are hosting several leagues simultaneously they manage to keep a high level of professionalism in each league.

Thank you also to Racespot for the awesome broadcasts, it’s not easy to keep the energy level and interest up in these long broadcasts, but they manage it and do a great job in keeping the viewer engaged!
