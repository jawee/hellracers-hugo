One year ago, the team Hellracers officially started after a few weeks of recruiting and preparation. We managed to bring some of the top sim-racing talent in Sweden together into one team and we aimed to drive together, improve together and have some fun together. Even though it is important to set up goals and achieve things, it’s not worth as much if we don’t have fun on the way there. We strongly believe that expanding a team too fast will create subgroups and the overall team feeling might get lost, which is why we have expanded quite slowly and found drivers who we think fit the team both with their skill level but also that will be part of the group and strengthen the team feeling.

So what have we done during this last year? We have found a great sponsor in Tershine, a Swedish company that has everything you need to keep your (IRL) car in good shape. We have raced in official races, although the amount of races per week is very varied within the team and typically on the lower side. Endurance racing and leagues have mostly been the name of the game and we have participated and got good results in a number of leagues, such as DGFX Endurance (2nd place in both GTE class and LMP1 class), DGFX Clubsport (2nd place in Sport class) as well as the Swedish iRacing League (1st place in both GTE and GT3 class) and the Scandinavian Club League (1st place). We qualified three cars to the Race of Vikings, an event where the Nordic countries competed against each other, and our three cars all scored points to secure a second place for Team Sweden.

The results and our vibrant paint schemes have definitely made others start to recognize the Hellracers and it is awesome to see that the name is starting to spread. We have made a point in not only being recognized for the results but that we are respectful and fair on the track, and we believe that it pays off in the long run. Rather get second place and keep the respect of the competitors than going all in and destroying other peoples races to get that first spot. In real life racing, things might be different, but we are doing this to have fun above everything else. 

Our planned team get-together during the DTM race at the Swedish Anderstorp track this year was unfortunately cancelled due to the ongoing pandemic so our first time meeting all in person will have to be postponed. However, doing all our racing online means that a few of us meet almost every night on Discord and train a few laps together, race together, talk beer or motorsport together or just hang out and plan the next upgrade to the rig. It’s a great balance of fun and serious racing, and we hope to continue in that spirit moving forward. 

Soon, the qualifications start for this upcoming season with leagues such as SCO, IVRA (previously DGFX), NEO Endurance, etc. We also have ongoing leagues, for example iRacing Endurance Series and BMW 120, where we usually get one or two cars on the grid. So we intend to keep on racing, keep on improving and above all - keep having fun!
