Time for another update! Once again, it will be a collection of what has 
happened since last time. For more frequent updates, we post on our instagram

#### GSI Endurance Series by IVRA and VCO, 1000 km at Watkins Glen
IVRA Endurance now has a collaboration with Gomez Sim Industries and therefore 
the series has changed name, but it’s still the same format and we still 
compete with two cars, one LMP2 and one GT3 Pro. This week’s track was Watkins 
Glen, a track where our drivers usually are fast. The LMP2 had a rough 
qualification session and ended up almost at the back of the field but climbed 
fast and were up in P5 just a few stints in. A collision caused by the LMP2 
with a resulting penalty put them back again, and the climb had to start over. 
Two safety cars helped them out and they ended up in P5 again over the finish 
line. A strong performance!

The GT3 Pro had a better qualifying and started in P4 and had a solid P3 after 
a few laps. That’s pretty much where the car drove almost all race until right 
at the end, where one of the faster cars got caught in a collision during the 
restart after a safety car period. The other main contender for the P1 position 
got two penalties in the end and had to go in for a stop and go, meaning that 
our GT3 had a pretty easy ride to the finish line and took our first IVRA win 
in the GT3. We have had victories in LMP2 and GTE before, but not in GT3. Now 
we can tick that box as well!

#### Simracing for ALS Norge (Norway)
Team SlowMo from Norway arranges one charity race each year and this year it 
was for the ALS Norway foundation. We started as the only Swedish team in a 
cloud of Norwegian teams. With the Club Scandinavia League and other 
communities we race quite a bit with Norwegian teams so it feels good to do it 
while contributing to a good cause. We put one Porsche RSR and our trusty LMP2 
on the grid.

The race had connection issues on a level rarely seen on iRacing, we have never
experienced something so bad. Unfortunately this disrupted the race several 
times and even though the organizers did their best, the racing of course 
suffered from this. In the end, the safety car was brought out a couple of 
times to give the disconnecting teams a chance to catch back up. This also 
meant that the standings in the race was hard to follow since teams went up and 
down the field during the disconnects.

In the end, we ended up with a P2 in the GTE field and P3 in the LMP2, not 
undeserved but maybe a bit unexpected given how the race developed. This also 
meant that Sebastian’s first race with us ended up with a P2, a good start!

#### 24 hours of Daytona
One of the biggest events on iRacing, gathering teams from all over the world 
to fight it out on the Daytona road course. It’s also the first event of the 
year when a lot of people are hungry for racing after the Christmas break. We 
decided to start with only one car to avoid too long driving stints, meaning we 
divided the 24 hours on six drivers. A solid performance by all drivers with 
very few mistakes over the entire race meant we brought home a P4 in our split, 
with the last overtake being done by Niklas in the bus stop on the second to 
last lap. Awesome effort!

#### IVRA Clubsport
Two races have taken place in the Clubsport league, the 400 km at VIR and 700 
km at Road Atlanta. We took P4 in VIR after a great performance on a fun track 
that is not driven enough! Road Atlanta was a tough mistress and a bit too 
eventful for us to make it possible with a top five finish and we had to settle 
for P9. We really enjoy the Clubsport series though, it is sometimes seen as 
the “little brother” to the Endurance series but brings another flavor of 
racing altogether and can definitely stand on its own.

It’s time for 400 km at Zolder already next week, another fun track that will 
definitely bring some intense racing!
