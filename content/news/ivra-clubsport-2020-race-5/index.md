We have now passed the halfway mark of the Clubsport series and the next to last race took place at Suzuka over 2.4 hours. So far, the races have more often than not involved some events that put our cars a bit further down the list than what we want, either by our own or other cars’ mistakes. This race started out in a very positive way, with our cars gridding up in P3 and P4 after a good qualifying session, and obviously having a competitive pace for this round.

Well, not long into the race things started to go south yet again. One of the cars got a drive-through penalty after an incident, not much to say about but it put them way back in the field after an otherwise promising start. For the other Hellracers car, things were looking more promising and they led the field for some time.

And then, the pace car emerged on track… Now, to be honest, the way things unfolded we can not put it all on the pace car, but it definitely would have been better for us to not have the pace car. Our car in the lead did their full service during the pace car, while many others just did a quick fuel stop and that led to the previously leading Hellracers car also dropping down through the field. 

We finished in 9th and 11th, which is decent given how the race unfolded, but yet again, we come away with the feeling of not getting the result that we know that we can achieve. With only one race to go, the chances of an overall podium finish looks slim, but there being a lot of points at stake in the last race all we can do is try to get a better payback for our effort next time.
