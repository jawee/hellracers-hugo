In the beginning of 2021, some team members competed in the Virtual time attack series, hosted by [timeattacknu.se](https://timeattacknu.se), usually an organizer of real racing but recently also virtual series. Philip came away with an honorable 2nd place overall in the series and also 3rd place in the race series, that was run as a separate competition next to the time attack series.

During the season, Rickard found the idea of doing it IRL so intriguing that he bought a car and is now preparing for driving a full season in the real Time attack series! He found a really nice BMW 135i in Germany and will drive in the Club class. We hope that the Covid situation will be good enough for the rest of the team to come and cheer for him! Really great to see real racing and sim racing getting closer and closer together.
