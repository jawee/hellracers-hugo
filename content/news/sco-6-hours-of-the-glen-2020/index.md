Since we don’t have any ongoing leagues or too many commitments, when SCO invited teams to their 6 hours of the Glen it sounded like a great event to get some serious racing. We joined with two GTE cars and since the Ford GT GTE at the moment is hard to beat in endurance, we chose it as our car for the event.

SCO is one of the most competitive leagues on iRacing and even though this was a one-off event, it was a high strength of field in both classes (LMP2 and GTE). Watkins Glen is also typically a track which most drivers know well, and the qualification round showed that it was indeed true. One tenth of a second in qualifying meant 3-4 spots up or down in the starting position, that is how tight it was. We managed to squeeze both cars into the top 15, which was ok in this sort of playing field.

At the end of the first stint, it became clear that the tyres were really worn out and both cars spun out, dropping back in the field. The car driven by Wilhelm (and Philip, although he never got the chance to drive…) was taken out by an unfortunate overtaking attempt by another GTE and Wilhelm had to retire just over an hour into the event. However, the car driven by Niklas and Stellan continued on, and they made their way up in the field due to a steady good pace while a lot of other cars had issues with staying on the track in one piece.

End result after 6 hours of racing was an honoring P10, which we are quite proud of given the competitors. It wasn’t the best of our races, making the tenth place even more impressive, and we got another receipt that our GTE drivers are a force to be reckoned with.
