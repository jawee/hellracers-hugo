Staying true to the Hellracers long tradition of second places, Philip settled with an overall second place in the Apex GT4 series this summer. It is a league using the two GT4 cars (Porsche 718 Cayman and BMW M4) on the iRacing service, where the setups are fixed and provided by the Apex Racing Academy giving all competitors an even playing field. That makes Philipâ€™s effort even more impressive - in all the races, he finished as worst in fifth place with a second place in the last race of the season as his best finish.

The league also used reversed starting order in the feature race for P1 to P10 in the first heats, producing some really exciting racing in the feature race. Followers of the excellent broadcast provided by Apex have been able to see some nail-biting action with a lot of close racing and overtaking throughout the race. We have been following the league closely and we are certain that more than one Hellracer will attend the next time! Thanks to Apex for a fun season!
