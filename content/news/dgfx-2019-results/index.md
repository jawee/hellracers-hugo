The championship final standings are now official and the two Hellracers entries finished in second place overall in both classes. After the fuel mishap, the LMP1 car was never really close to fighting about the championship in the final race while the GTE car finished with the same amount of points as the winner, but with fewer victories. We are really happy and proud of the results, as it is our first league as a team and we didnâ€™t think we would fight for the win. Thanks to DGFX for putting together a fun and professional league!
