On iRacing, a number of special events are arranged each year where teams, or solo racers, compete in endurance racing. These are official events, meaning that the normal split mechanisms are in place, and the races affects your iRating, a concept in iRacing to put racers with equal speed in races together.

One of these special events is the 10 hours of Road Atlanta, which offers a multiclass experience similar to the iRacing IMSA series, meaning the Daytona Prototype, the GTE class and two GT3 cars. Hellracers had two GTE cars on the starting line, one Ferrari GTE driven by Jonas Bodin, Wilhelm Wiberg and Stellan Lindeberg and a Ford GT GTE driven by Marcus Simonsson, Hampus Baaz and Andreas Olsson.

The Ford showed great pace already in qualifying, starting in the third position. The Ferrari had a tougher time to set a time and started 9th. Once the race was underway though, the Ferrari with Jonas Bodin behind the wheel showed a good pace and was determined to climb in the field. Two incidents later, with one leading to the car being crumbled beyond recognition, it was decided to park the car and take the DNF. No shadow on Jonas, who wasnâ€™t at fault for any of the incidents, but rather at the wrong place at the wrong time.

For the Ford crew, the race continued. With one car out of the race and a free Saturday for the rest of the team, the Discord chat became a hangout during the race with a lively chat. This made Andreas Olsson thrive, and he put in his best laps when the chat was as most lively. While others, such as Marcus Simonsson, had to ask for a slightly less active chat to keep his concentration.

When the darkness fell over Road Atlanta, it was clear that a great final position was within reach, and the Ford roared over the finish line as third in class. Yet another show of strength by the Hellracers.
