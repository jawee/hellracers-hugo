For a couple of weeks now, several team members have been competing in the official Swedish national championship arranged by Svenska Bilsportförbundet. After three qualification races, each with a semi-final and a final, to determine who were going to compete in the grand finale, now was the time to crown the champion. To be completely honest, none of us aspired for becoming the champion, there’s some fierce competition in Swedish simracing and drivers like Carl Jansson from CoRe Simracing and Robin Östlund from GOTeam Racing are not only fast in general, but they also have way more experience than our drivers in the car that was used in the competition, the Porsche 911 GT3 Cup.

With that said, we still wanted to measure ourselves and be part of the competition so we squeezed this in with our other leagues and managed to put eight of our drivers on the starting grid for the final race.

Unfortunately, the racing was on a level that is below what you would expect in a national championship, which meant that if you were in the middle of the pack, you had to rely partially on luck to even be able to finish the race. This was taken up another notch in the final where a few major incidents involving a lot of cars and some unsuccessful passing attempts put some of our cars on the sideline.

One who didn’t get caught up in these incidents was Magnus who finished overall in P10, which was our best result. Just behind him was Hampus in P11, while the rest was further down the field. Given the high level of competition a P10 finish is an achievement, and the number of drivers in the final race from Hellracers once again show that we have a very high lowest level and a great width in the team.
