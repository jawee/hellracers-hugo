It all came down to this - a small lead in the championship but the guys in second place, Helimedia, had proven before that they had a really high pace when they wanted to. 4 hours at Interlagos would decide which team ended up as overall winners in the DGFX Clubsport series, and we put Jonas and Marcus as pilots of our 911 Cup car. No one in the team really drives the 911 Cup in any other series, so it’s always a few days of just getting up to speed again in the car before each race. However, Interlagos is a track that is fairly common in official series so it was more getting used to the car on an already known track.

P3 after qualification with our main competitors Helimedia in pole was an ok starting position for the race. Qualification is always important, but over 4 hours, so many things happen so one spot here and there is usually not as crucial as it is in shorter races.

Before half time, our car had unfortunately spun out no less than two times, increasing the challenge to compete for the championship since at the same time, the Helimedia car was having a great race in the front of the pack. It has been an unfortunate trend of lately, that our usually very stable drivers have spun out of all sorts of races. Something to keep on working on, for sure.

Our guys made an impressive come back and actually passed most of the field during the second half of the race, but the top two cars were not possible to reach and we had to settle for a P3 spot in the race and another second place in the championship.

This is now our third time ending up in second place in a championship that stretches over several months, and once again - even though it is an achievement to be proud over, as drivers you still want that first spot. Both the DGFX Endurance series and their Clubsport series have given us a lot of excitement and fun racing, and that is really what it is about. The result can be seen as secondary, but it is always more fun to have a great race AND end up in first position. We almost completed both, but the second place tastes less bitter when you had a lot of fun on the way there.

Thanks DGFX for this time, we’ll see each other again for sure! And once again, congratulations to Helimedia for their victory!
