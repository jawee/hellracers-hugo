Here comes a rather late update on the latest news related to Hellracers and what we are doing. We have been doing one update per race previously but due to real life commitments, it hasn't been happening for a while now. And the two or three readers who actually read this are outraged, I assume. :-)

#### Collaboration with tershine continues!
We are happy to announce that our collaboration will continue for yet another year and we will continue to proudly wear the big ‘t’ on our cars!

#### IVRA Endurance 1000 km at Red Bull Ring
The 16th of October we went to the Red Bull Ring for the IVRA Endurance second race of the season. After a rather unimpressive qualification round for both cars, we had put ourselves in an unnecessarily difficult position where we had to climb through the field. This year’s competition is really tough, which is so much fun, but it also makes it harder to do just that - climb through the field. Even the AM cars have good pace, so no overtake comes easy.

We are really proud of the result though, after fighting for almost 6 hours both cars ended up P4 in the Pro field! That’s a massive achievement given the starting positions of the cars, and even though we might have been able to finish even higher with a better start, we are happy with that given the circumstances.

#### IVRA Clubsport 400 km at Mid-Ohio
Next race for us was another IVRA race, this time in the Porsche 992 GT3 Cup car and the Clubsport series. On the 30th of October we put our car on the grid and showed some great pace from the start. Once again the width of the team showed where we put drivers who are not so well versed with the 992 cup car behind the wheel and they still fought for a podium finish. Unfortunately, the race had a big number of punts and our car suffered a few of them. In the end, we also made mistakes and punted a few cars of our own, giving us a rightful punishment, clouding all hope of a podium finish.

We finished P8 after all of this, which felt like a disappointment given the pace and that it looked really good for a long time in the race. Again the result shows that besides pure pace, the races are won by managing the traffic and keeping the nose clean. This time, just a few mistakes cost us many lost points.

#### 10 hours of Suzuka - Special event by iRacing
A few times every year, iRacing runs what they call “special events”. Some of them are sprint races or other events, but most of them are endurance races. What they have in common though, is that they generally gather very many of the iRacing users and the competitions get a lot of attention.

We have been competing in quite a few, but have never really come out on top. But for this year’s 10 hours of Suzuka, that changed! To be honest, we didn’t compete in the most popular time slot, but still we managed to claim victory in the top split of a GT3 endurance race on iRacing, which is not a small feat. After 10 hours of racing, the gap to P2 was only 4 seconds, which is a telling sign that the competition was tight! P1-P4 was really tight all race long and we switched positions back and forth a few times. But when day turned into night, our car put in some awesome stints with good pace and very few mistakes, leading us to overall victory! 

#### Swedish championship sponsored by Porsche
To round off this update, we are currently competing in the Swedish championship sponsored by Porsche and in the first race, Philip managed a P3! The Swedish sim racing community just keeps on getting bigger… and faster! Awesome to see! We will compete in the championship for a few weeks to come and will make sure to post an update here and on our Instagram when we have a result!
