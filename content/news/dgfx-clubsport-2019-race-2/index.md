Time for race 2 in the DGFX Clubsport series! This race was scheduled just a few days after one of the four yearly major patches from iRacing. This time around, our car in the series, the Porsche GT3 Cup car got a major update on several parts, but most importantly the tire model. Jonas Bodin and Hampus Baaz, our two pilots for the race, spent the week practicing and tried to get accustomed to the new feeling of the car. Once Saturday came, it was the end of practice and time to get serious!

Jonas qualified the car in fifth place, and showed that the team was contending for a top position also in this race. The competitors are starting to get accustomed to the name - Hellracers. After some incidents in the start, where poor HughJass went off already in the first curve - new tire model, remember - Jonas picked up a few spots and things started to look promising. Third place, and it was time for the next pilot behind the wheel - Hampus! 

Unfortunately, after only a handful of laps, the new tire model and car updates got the better of Hampus and he spun out, hitting the tire wall and causing some damage to the car. After the repairs, the car was a few laps down from the leaders and the rest of the race went towards learning about the new car updates in a race environment to be as well prepared as we can for the next race. We ended up in 13th place, but with a lot of new lessons learned.

In the end, Team Helimedia won the GT3 Cup class in a convincing manner with over a lap down to the next car, the Gold Racing Team with another good result. Congratulations to you guys, and see you in a month!
