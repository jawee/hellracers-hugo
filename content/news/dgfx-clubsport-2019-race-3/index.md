Time for the third race of the Clubsport series and to take on the challenging curves of the Canadian Tire Motorsports Park with the added difficulty of managing the intense traffic. Marcus Simonsson and Hampus Baaz took on the challenge to pilot the 911 GT3 Cup with Hellracers’ colors on it, to take revenge on the last race where the car said hello to the barriers surrounding the Brands Hatch circuit. 

It started off with some technical difficulties in the qualification session, leading to Marcus starting 11th - far from where he wanted to be. Once the green flag flew, he started to climb in positions though, and once it was time for Hampus the car was up in a podium position. A lot of cars had problems with the traffic and it was an intense fight for positions while managing the slower classes. Our car flew through traffic without too many scratches, and even though we couldn’t challenge the NAB Racing car for the victory in the end, the car crossed the finish line in second place with a comfortable cushion down to Meraki Racing in third place.
