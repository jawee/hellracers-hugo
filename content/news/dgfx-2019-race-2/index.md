Just one week after the Petit Le Mans, it was time for the second race of the season in the DGFX league. Moving from the narrow Watkins Glen to the much wider Circuit of the Americas (COTA) meant that a very different type of race was to be expected. The wide run-off zones of COTA makes it possible for a crashed car to limp back to the pits, or a tow zone, without disturbing the ongoing race, meaning that the need for pace car is very much reduced.

This was also the case, COTA offered a race with very few pace car laps and mostly open racing, which in the end is what all teams prefer. The wide track also offers a lot of overtaking opportunities for the faster classes with only a few places where it is hard to fit two cars next to each other (such as the esses).

With less involvement between the classes, it opens up for more racing within each class. In this race, there were some nice duels and some actual fighting for positions. However, as expected, when racing for six hours and with different fuel strategies, for long periods of time you are driving “by yourself” and focusing on managing traffic. The mix of it and the feeling of accomplishment when finishing is part of what makes endurance racing such a thrill.

This race was almost a perfect double by Hellracers, but after being involved in an incident, the LMP1 car piloted by Hampus Baaz and Magnus Vallström, had to settle with second place, starting from third. Still, a very respectable position in this field! Marcus Simonsson and Stellan Lindeberg managed to take Hellracers’ first win in DGFX in the GTE car, a really strong performance! They started from pole position, the second pole in a row, and kept their nerves.
